# Checker workflow (checker.wdl)
This script runs pipelines on a known set of inputs, and validates them against expected outputs with a quick md5sum check. On Terra, both inputs and outputs are pulled from the UCSC-owned topmed_workflow_testing bucket.

This workflow is not simply a copy of the check_gds/check_merged_gds steps found in vcf-to-gds and ld-pruning respectively. For instance, check_gds would not determine if the unique_variant_ids step ran successfully, instead, it performs a separate validation check. Speaking of which, because the inputs are known to not take very long in check_gds, it is enabled *by default.* If you are replacing these files with your own sets of inputs and outputs, and that set is non-downsampled, modern TOPMed data, you may wish to consider skipping this step.

**If relying on the truth files located in topmed_workflow_testing, make sure to run this on the full array of input VCF files (except chrX).** If you do not run this on the full array of provided files, the resulting gds files will have unexpected variant IDs, likely resulting in an md5sum mismatch. That does not mean the gds files are invalid, it just means their IDs are not exactly the same as they would be if you had generated them all together.

The second workflow, ld-pruning, is hardcoded to fail on chrX. As such chrX has been removed from the checker pipeline entirely, but a truth file can be found in the appropriate Google Cloud bucket should you wish to do a manual comparison.
