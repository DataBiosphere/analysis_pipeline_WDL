# Significant differences between CWL and WDL versions

# All Workflows
## Strictly Necessary Changes  
* Filenames are generated by calling the Seven Bridges API in the CWL. This isn't possible in WDL, so inputs are generated from JSONs instead.  
* The original CWL does not have an option for disk space, but the WDL does, as it is a soft requirement for running on Terra.  
* The CWL generates config files using an InlineJavascriptRequirement, which is run before the CWL equivivalent of a task's command section begins. The WDL generates them using an inline Python script during the beginning of a task's command section.  

## "Not Strictly Necessary But In WDL This Makes More Sense"
* The original CWL allocates memory and CPUs on an overall level, while the WDL does it on a task level. In other words, the WDL is more granular.  
	* Reasoning: GCS has stricter requirements than AWS regarding storage. Doing it this way also allows the check GDS step, which takes a lot more resources, to call more than the rest of the the WDL, saving money.

## Different Design Choices
* The CWL imports other CWLs. The WDL does not import other WDLs, except in the case of the checker workflow.  
	* Reasoning: It is possible for WDLs to contain just tasks and be imported into another task, but in some contexts it can be slightly less secure.

# Workflow A
## Strictly Necessary Changes  
* The WDL relocalizes all files into the working directory in the unique variant IDs step. [This issue is explained in detail here](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/analysis_pipeline_WDL/issues/2).

## "Not Strictly Necessary But In WDL This Makes More Sense"
* The WDL will not start the check_gds task if check_gds is false. The CWL will start the check_gds task regardless and generate a config file, and the true/false only applies to calling the  script.
	* Reasoning: The way GCS billing works, this has the potential of being cheaper. Otherwise we would spend for having a powerful non-preemptible compute designed for an intense task, then only using that compute for making a text file.

## Error Handling
* The WDL can correctly handle a mixture of file extensions, not so much by design, but due to the specifics of implementation. The CWL will handle such a mixture incorrectly in check_gds (but can correctly handle a homogenous group, such as all being bcf files).

# Workflow B
This section is unorganized as it is still being developed.  
* WDL does not have an equivalent to ScatterMethod:DotProduct so it instead scatters using zip().
* The output prefix is not used for the subset_gds task in the CWL (at least on SB), but is used in the WDL.
