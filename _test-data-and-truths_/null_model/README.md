These files were taken straight from the original Python pipeline's repo, with the exception of the two Null_model_mixed* files which came from the GENESIS Null Model sample workspace, based upon Revision 17 of the CWL null model workflow, on Seven Bridges. The details of their creation has been lost to time, but it is known they are based on open data. It is not recommend to use these for your "real" data; they are presented here as truth files.
