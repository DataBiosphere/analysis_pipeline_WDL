Unlike most truth files in this repo, these files were generated on Seven Bridges using a GCP instance, rather than the default AWS. This was due to a suspected bug with how AWS handles the conditionalinv test case. They were generated July 6th, 2021.

By default, the checker workflow will check against the GCP files for the conditionalinv test case, but the AWS files are included here too.
