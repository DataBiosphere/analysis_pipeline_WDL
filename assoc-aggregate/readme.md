Note that n_segments is based upon the entire genome *regardless of the number of chromosomes you are running on.* If you set n_segments = 100 and run on just chr1 and chr2, you can expect there to be about 15 segments because chr1 and chr2 together make up about 15% of the human genome. Furthermore, at a minimum, the code automatically will create 1 segment per chromosome, so setting n_segments = 2, 4, or 10 when running on just chr1 and chr2 will each result in just two segments even though you might expect dividing the entire genome into 2, 4, or 10 pieces would result in one segment covering all of chr1 and chr2.

Unlike most WDLs in this repository, this one has some major differences in how it works versus the CWL. These differences should not change the output, but any future code maintainers should take note of cwl-vs-wdl-dev.md in the `_documentation_` folder of this repo.
